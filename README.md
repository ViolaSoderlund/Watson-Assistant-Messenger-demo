### Setting up your Facebook app

A Facebook app is what links your dedicated facebook page to your node.js app's webhook, and is where you will configure various permissions for your API, generate access tokens, and choose what events are sent to your webhook.

Setup your Facebook app with Facebook's [setup guide][]

As long as your webhook URL is dynamic, you'll have to edit your Facebook application's webhook events any time it changes.

#### `webhook_contract.js`

To connect your node.js app with your Facebook app, you need a `verifyToken` and a `pageAccessToken`. For that, go to: https://developers.facebook.com/apps/<YOUR APP ID>/messenger/settings/.

Choose your own verify token string and add its value to `verifyToken` in your contract file. Then configure your Facebook app accordingly at Webhooks by clicking on Edit events.

The `pageAccessToken` can be generated under the Token Generation section.


### Test your application's functionality

Test your webhook verification by submitting: `curl -X GET "localhost:1337/webhook?hub.verify_token=<YOUR_VERIFY_TOKEN>&hub.challenge=CHALLENGE_ACCEPTED&hub.mode=subscribe"`

Test your webhook events by submitting: `curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST "localhost:1337/webhook" -d '{"object": "page", "entry": [{"messaging": [{"message": "TEST_MESSAGE"}]}]}'`
